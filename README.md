Participation polls for group events

Features
--------

* Create one or many polls
* Each poll has a randomized URL; only people who get the link can have access
* Suggest one or many dates
* Customize the choices (text and color), add more choices
* Simple usage, no authentication
* Mobile friendly
* No ad, no fee, no spying, just OpenSource

Server Installation
-------------------

If you want to run Kyela on your server :

* Install Symfony 2.5
* Download the bundle :
    git clone https://github.com/abienvenu/Kyela.git
* Add the bundle in your AppKernel.php :
```php
new Abienvenu\KyelaBundle\KyelaBundle(),
```
* Include the route from your app/config/routing.yml :
```YAML
kyela:
    resource: "@KyelaBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix: /kyela
```
* Include the config from your app/config.config.yml :
    imports:
	- { resource: "@KyelaBundle/Resources/config/config.yml" }

* Add Kyela to the bundles handled by assetic in app/config/config.yml :
```YAML
assetic:
    bundles:        [ 'KyelaBundle' ]
```

* Dump the assets :
    app/console assetic:dump

* Install fonts :
Bootstrap glyphicons needs fonts, which cannot be handled properly by assetic.
Install the assets :
    app/console assets:install --symlink
Add some rewritule to your apache configuration :
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/kyela/web/app_dev.php/fonts/(.*) /kyela/web/bundles/kyela/fonts/$1 [L]

Customisation
-------------

You can create a file in Resources/translations called "faq-me.en.html" or "about-me.en.html" to add questions/answers to the FAQ or About page.

For further customisation, you have to edit the code. Because of the licence (Affero GPL), you must publish the modified code as soon as your project is online.

TODO
----
* Auto-select each first form field
* Hide URL when creating a poll, generate a random one, let it editable only
* Fusionner newAction avec createAction dans les contr√¥leurs ? editAction avec updateAction ?
* Ajouter getPoll() en abstract sur Entity.php ?
* Dans AbstractController, override generateUrl pour lui rajouter la pollUrl ?
* Nice handling of bad (forged) URLs
* Ability to switch language
* Edit Participant should let him edit his choices as well
* Make CSRF work (it is disabled in my main config.yml)
* Add confirmation before deleting a Participant/Event/Choice
* Functional test for Participation
* Create a default list of choices when creating a new poll
* Sort dates
* Archive old dates
* Access to old dates
* Add instructions how to download the product via composer
* For a Poll, customize "Total" color cell at certain levels
* Add unicity constraint for (event, participant, choice)
* Ability to re-order choices
* Ability to use a glyphicon(s) for each choice
* formnovalidate is not valid HTML ?
* Comments/Forum

BUGS
----

* Clash if lowercase(url1) = lowercase(url2) ?
* When you click "FAQ" or "About" from a poll, the menu won't link back to the poll

FUTURE FEATURES
---------------

* Notification subscriptions
* Syndication
* Easy integration from remote websites
* Aggregate/Anonymous mode, for events with lots of participants: the grid only displays total numbers, you can add yourself, then you get a personal link to modify/delete your participation
* Integration with personal agendas ?
* Ability to restrict access to some admin buttons (edit choices, edit poll...) ?
* Make a logo, a favicon
* AJAX calls to avoid page reload when updating participation
